### 1. What is a Switch?

- A **network switch** is a Layer 2 (Data Link layer) device in the OSI model.
- Its main job: **forward Ethernet frames** intelligently based on **MAC addresses**.
- Unlike a hub (which just floods traffic everywhere), a switch learns where devices are and sends traffic only to the right port.

---

### 2. What is a MAC Address?

- **MAC (Media Access Control) address** = unique 48-bit identifier assigned to every network interface card (NIC).
- Written in hex: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
- **Structure**:

  - **First 24 bits (OUI)** â†’ identify manufacturer (Intel, Realtek, etc.).
  - **Last 24 bits** â†’ unique device identifier (assigned sequentially by the vendor).

- Burned into hardware (though can be spoofed).

---

### 3. How Switches Use MAC Addresses

- Switches keep a **MAC Address Table (also called CAM table)**:

  - Maps each MAC address to the switch port it was learned from.
  - Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E â†’ Port 3`.

- **Learning**:

  - When a frame arrives, the switch notes the source MAC and associates it with that port.

- **Forwarding / Filtering**:

  - If the destination MAC is in the table â†’ send frame only to that port.
  - If unknown â†’ flood frame to all ports except the source.

- **Aging**:

  - Entries in the table have a timer (usually 300 sec). If no traffic from a MAC within that time, the entry is removed.

---

### 4. Types of MAC Addresses

- **Unicast MAC**: one-to-one (most common).
- **Broadcast MAC**: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` â†’ sent to all devices.
- **Multicast MAC**: special group address (e.g. for streaming).

---

### 5. Switch Behavior with MAC

- **Collision domain**: each switch port is its own collision domain (unlike hubs).
- **Broadcast domain**: by default, all ports on a switch are in the same broadcast domain. VLANs can segment this.
- **Duplex**: switches support full-duplex, so no collisions on a single port.

---

### 6. Security & MAC

- Switches can be configured with **port security**:

  - Limit number of MACs per port.
  - Bind a port to a specific MAC.
  - Protect against MAC flooding attacks (which try to overflow the CAM table).

---

### 7. Key Differences (Hub vs Switch)

- **Hub**: blind, repeats all frames to all ports (Layer 1).
- **Switch**: smart, forwards only where needed using MAC address table (Layer 2).

---

ðŸ“Œ **Summary nugget**:
A switch is basically a librarian. The MAC address is like a bookâ€™s call number. The switch builds a catalog (MAC table) mapping each "book" (device) to a "shelf" (port). This way, instead of shouting across the library (hub), it walks straight to the right shelf and delivers the book.

## Understanding Router and How Internet Works

## Understanding Networkign Layers

# **Complete Networking Notes: Routers, Internet & Layers**

## **Part 1: Understanding Routers**

### 1. What is a Router?

- A **router** is a Layer 3 (Network layer) device in the OSI model.
- Main job: **forward IP packets** between different networks based on **IP addresses**.
- Key difference from switches: routers connect different networks, switches connect devices within the same network.
- Routers make decisions based on **routing tables** and **routing protocols**.

---

### 2. How Routers Work

**IP Address vs MAC Address**:

- Routers work with **IP addresses** (logical addressing, Layer 3).
- They still use MAC addresses for local delivery (Layer 2).
- **Process**: Router receives packet â†’ checks destination IP â†’ consults routing table â†’ forwards to next hop.

**Routing Table**:

- Contains network destinations and how to reach them.
- Example entry: `192.168.1.0/24 â†’ Gateway: 10.0.0.1, Interface: eth0`.
- Shows: destination network, subnet mask, next hop, outgoing interface, metric (cost).

---

### 3. Router Functions

**Packet Forwarding**:

- Examines destination IP address in packet header.
- Looks up best route in routing table (longest prefix match).
- Decrements TTL (Time To Live) field.
- Forwards packet to next router or destination.

**Network Address Translation (NAT)**:

- Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses.
- Enables multiple devices to share one public IP.
- Types: Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, PAT (Port Address Translation).

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:

- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
- Also provides subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers.

**Firewall & Security**:

- Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic.
- Stateful packet inspection.
- VPN termination.

---

### 4. Types of Routing

**Static Routing**:

- Manual configuration of routes.
- Good for small, stable networks.
- No bandwidth overhead.
- Example: `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`.

**Dynamic Routing**:

- Routers automatically learn routes using protocols.
- Adapts to network changes.
- **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)**:
  - **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol) - distance vector.
  - **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First) - link state.
  - **EIGRP** (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) - hybrid.
- **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)**:
  - **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol) - used on internet backbone.

---

## **Part 2: How the Internet Works**

### 1. Internet Architecture

**Hierarchical Structure**:

- **Tier 1 ISPs**: Backbone providers (AT&T, Verizon, Level 3).
- **Tier 2 ISPs**: Regional providers, buy transit from Tier 1.
- **Tier 3 ISPs**: Local providers, customers of Tier 2.
- **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**: Where ISPs interconnect.

**Autonomous Systems (AS)**:

- Collection of networks under single administrative control.
- Each AS has unique AS number (ASN).
- BGP routes between ASes.

---

### 2. Key Internet Protocols

**Domain Name System (DNS)**:

- Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- Hierarchical structure: Root â†’ TLD (.com, .org) â†’ Authoritative.
- Process: Browser â†’ Local DNS â†’ Root â†’ TLD â†’ Authoritative â†’ Response chain.

**HTTP/HTTPS**:

- **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) - web communication.
- **HTTPS** - HTTP over SSL/TLS for security.
- Request methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Status codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error).

**TCP/IP Stack**:

- Foundation protocols of the internet.
- **IP** handles addressing and routing.
- **TCP** ensures reliable delivery.
- **UDP** for faster, connectionless communication.

---

### 3. Internet Communication Flow

**Example: Browsing a Website**

1. **DNS Resolution**: Browser asks DNS for website's IP address.
2. **Route Discovery**: Packets travel through multiple routers using BGP.
3. **TCP Connection**: Three-way handshake establishes connection.
4. **HTTP Request**: Browser sends GET request for webpage.
5. **Response**: Server sends HTML, CSS, JavaScript files.
6. **Rendering**: Browser displays the webpage.

**Packet Journey**:

- Your device â†’ Home router (NAT) â†’ ISP â†’ Internet backbone â†’ Destination ISP â†’ Target server.
- Each router makes independent forwarding decisions.
- Packets might take different paths (load balancing).

### 2. Complete Network Communication Example

**Scenario**: Computer A (192.168.1.10) sends webpage request to Server B (203.0.113.50).

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Application Layer**: Browser creates HTTP GET request.

2. **Transport Layer**: TCP adds port information (destination port 80).

3. **Network Layer**:

   - IP determines destination (203.0.113.50) is on different network.
   - Adds IP header with source (192.168.1.10) and destination IPs.

4. **Data Link Layer**:

   - Computer checks ARP table for router's MAC address.
   - Creates Ethernet frame with router's MAC as destination.

5. **Physical Layer**: Converts frame to electrical signals.

6. **At the Router**:

   - Receives frame, strips Ethernet header.
   - Examines IP packet, consults routing table.
   - Forwards packet toward destination network.
   - May pass through multiple routers (hops).

7. **At Destination Network**:
   - Final router delivers packet to server's network.
   - Switch forwards frame to correct server port.
   - Server processes request and sends response back.
